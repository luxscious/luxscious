# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Gabriella!

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer and cybersecurity researcher based in Canada, with a deep love for solving real-world problems through code â€” and a slightly unhealthy obsession with competitive gaming ðŸ˜„.

### ðŸ§  What I Do

I'm a recent Master's graduate in Software Engineering from Western University, where I focused my research on securing **EV charging infrastructure**. My thesis explored open-source tools like **EVerest** and **MQTT**, modeled real-world attack scenarios, and built **machine learning-based intrusion detection systems** to keep our electric future safe. ðŸ”Œâš¡

Professionally, Iâ€™ve worn many hats:
- **Full-Stack Developer** at [Hyperpad](https://hyperpad.com), a YC-backed startup â€” I led backend development, built GraphQL APIs, collaborated with designers, and mentored new devs.
- **Teaching Assistant** at Western, where I ran labs on AWS, JavaFX, web dev, and more. I loved helping students build confidence in their code.
- **Hackathon warrior** ðŸ¥‡ â€” Iâ€™ve competed in multiple hackathons and built projects like *Val-T*, an AI agent for gamers that gives post-match feedback based on gameplay data.

### ðŸ›  Tech I Work With

- **Languages**: Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Ruby on Rails, Node.js
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), Docker, Nginx
- **Data**: Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Firebase, MQTT
- **ML & Security**: Scikit-learn, packet sniffing tools (Kali Linux), intrusion detection systems
